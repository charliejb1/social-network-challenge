 ## Title: 
 
 Social Network Challenge 
  
 ## Description: 

In this project, there are 3 models used for the collection of user data. User.js for username, email and thoughts related to a user, thought.js for thoughtext that will be tied to a particular user, and reactions.js for reactions that will be tied to a particular thought. The thought and user controllers use the models to create, update and delete informetian based on user input. These controller functions are called based on a particular route which have all been defined within user and thoughts routes. In the video below, I demonstrate creating a user, a thought associated with that user, an updated thought, a reaction associated with that thought, and the deletion of that thought. 

Unable to accomplish: Delete routes for users and reactions were having errors. Friendslist associated with users was not complete.
